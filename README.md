Example QPython scripts

You have to install qpython on android to use (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipipal.qpyplus).
Also, you have to enable textToSpeech from google to use spoken text output.

I have written a little application upon those examples, but I don't want to post it yet...
